fuse-video
==========

These two tools, fuse-TS and fuse-DV, provide FUSE based filesystems that 
enable you to virtually concatenate a sequence of files. Given the purpose
of the tools, they work best with video files of course. 

The tools are tuned for the needs of the FeM/VOC CRS project (URL to come 
once it's publicly released) which contains some more documentation.
